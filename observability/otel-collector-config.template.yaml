## Vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry Collector configuration template.
##
## This config is intended as a starting point for any OTLP-based
## observability backend. By default it only exports to the "debug"
## exporter so you can verify that telemetry is flowing without
## sending data to any vendor.
##
## To use a specific backend (Datadog, OTLP to another collector,
## Prometheus, etc.), add an exporter under `exporters:` and then
## reference it from the pipelines below. See
## `otel-collector-config.datadog.yaml` in this same folder for an
## example Datadog configuration.
