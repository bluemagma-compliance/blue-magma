AI native Open Source GRC platform for founders built by the InfoSec community with love ❤️


# Overview
Blue Magma is intended to be built and used as an "Autonomous compliance platform" that founders can use to garner trust from their customers and become compliant with the laws, regulations and certifications that they need to succeed. We are building Blue Magma to be useful for both new founders and knowledgeable security practitioners. Blue Magma is built with the support of wonderful people at Utah State University, The SandBox program, CPAs in the Utah area and CISOs from the region as well. 

We are pretty sick and tired of the overpriced closed source solutions out there and want to build something that is better, faster, and makes use of recent developments in language models to make compliance a boost rather than a burden.

# I just want to use the damn thing
We can help you get compliant visit us at [trybluemagma.com](https://trybluemagma.com)

# How it works

Blue Magma is built around the Secure Controls Framework which is a meta framework that maps to hundreds of laws, frameworks and standards from across the world. [See SCF Frameworks](https://securecontrolsframework.com/start-here/included-laws-regulations-frameworks-lrf/)

We use AI (currently GPT-5.1) to help collect user requirements and evidence for controls. We are still working on an agent-native data structure to make collected evidence and requirements easy to explore by agents.

# expectations & contributions

We are open sourcing this to be transparent, and find vulnerabilities, bugs, and missing features. We would love your feedback and contributions. We just ask that you be patient with us as we build this in the open. 

Please feel free to open new issues and we will get to them as soon as we can. We ask that you fork the repo and make a pull request to the development branch. We will review your changes and get back to you as soon as we can.

We would love tips and tricks on how to implement controls and how you have been able to do it in the past. We hope to share your knowledge with the community as we build this out.
